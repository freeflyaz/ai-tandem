# ===== HOW THE CALCULATION WORKS =====
#
# The takeoff percentage is calculated using 4 weighted factors:
#   1. Wind Direction (40% of total score)
#   2. Wind Speed     (30% of total score)
#   3. Precipitation  (20% of total score) ← YES, RAIN IS INCLUDED!
#   4. Cloud Cover    (10% of total score)
#
# Example calculation:
#   Wind Direction: 45° (NE) = 100 points × 40% = 40.0 points
#   Wind Speed: 15 km/h      = 100 points × 30% = 30.0 points
#   Precipitation: 2mm rain  = 60 points × 20%  = 12.0 points  (100 - 2×20 = 60)
#   Cloud Cover: 30%         = 70 points × 10%  = 7.0 points   (100 - 30 = 70)
#   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   TOTAL SCORE = 89%

# ===== LOCATION SETTINGS =====
BREITENBERG_LAT=47.47056
BREITENBERG_LON=10.38222
BREITENBERG_ELEVATION=1690

# ===== WIND DIRECTION SCORING =====
# Define custom wind direction ranges and their scores
# Format: START-END:SCORE,START-END:SCORE,...
# Ranges should cover 0-360 degrees
#
# You can add as many ranges as you want for fine-grained control!
# Examples:
#
# Fine-grained (10-degree increments):
# WIND_DIRECTION_RANGES=0-10:100,10-20:95,20-30:100,30-45:100,45-60:100,60-90:95,90-120:90,120-135:85,135-150:60,150-180:50,180-190:30,190-200:25,200-225:20,225-270:10,270-300:5,300-315:10,315-360:100
#
# Very specific (5-degree increments for critical angles):
# WIND_DIRECTION_RANGES=0-5:100,5-10:98,10-15:100,15-20:100,20-45:100,45-90:100,90-135:90,135-180:60,180-225:30,225-270:20,270-315:10,315-360:100
#
# Default Breitenberg ranges (optimal: North, Northeast, East, Southeast):
WIND_DIRECTION_RANGES=0-45:100,45-90:100,90-135:90,135-180:60,180-225:30,225-270:20,270-315:10,315-360:100

# ===== WIND SPEED SCORING (km/h) =====
# 0-5 km/h: Too calm (50 points)
WIND_SPEED_0_5_SCORE=50
# 5-8 km/h: Light winds (70 points)
WIND_SPEED_5_8_SCORE=70
# 8-24 km/h: Perfect range (100 points)
WIND_SPEED_8_24_SCORE=100
# 24-29 km/h: Getting strong (60 points)
WIND_SPEED_24_29_SCORE=60
# 29-35 km/h: Too strong (30 points)
WIND_SPEED_29_35_SCORE=30
# 35+ km/h: Not flyable (10 points)
WIND_SPEED_35_PLUS_SCORE=10

# ===== CALCULATION WEIGHTS =====
# These weights determine how much each factor affects the final percentage
# Must total 100
WEIGHT_WIND_DIRECTION=40
WEIGHT_WIND_SPEED=30
WEIGHT_PRECIPITATION=20
WEIGHT_CLOUD_COVER=10

# ===== PRECIPITATION PENALTY =====
# Points deducted per mm of rain (from 100 base score)
# Example: 2mm rain = 100 - (2 × 20) = 60 points
# Example: 5mm rain = 100 - (5 × 20) = 0 points (minimum)
# Rain has 20% weight in total calculation
PRECIPITATION_PENALTY_PER_MM=20

# ===== DISPLAY SETTINGS =====
OPTIMAL_DIRECTIONS=North, Northeast, East, Southeast
